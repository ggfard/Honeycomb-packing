# Honeycomb-packing
Explores different ways of modeling and visualizing hexagonal lattices with various cell sizes and areas. I also explore how different lattices can be ovelaid on top of each other to better understand the structures presented in our [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.29.596484v1.full) of honeycomb built on 3D-printed foundations with various cell sizes.
