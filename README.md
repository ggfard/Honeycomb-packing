# Honeycomb-packing
This project explores a couple of methods for modeling hexagonal lattices with varying cell sizes. Inspired by different structures that emerge from honeycomb construction on 3D-printrd foundations with different cell sizes (described in our [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.29.596484v1.full)), I visualize how hexagonal lattices can be overlaid to begin to understand these emergent structurs.
