# Honeycomb-packing
This project explores a couple of methods for modeling hexagonal lattices with varying cell sizes. I visualized how different lattices can be overlaid to begin to understand the emergent structurs described in our [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.29.596484v1.full) on honeycomb construction on 3D-printed foundations with different cell sizes.
